# calculate_pin
Algorithm to calculate the shortest movements needed to reach pin-number

The user enters a pin and the algorithm calculates the shortest moves neccesary to reach this pin on a three digit rotating bike lock.
The first time this function runs the lock is at starting position 000, after that the starting position becomes the previous pin entered by the user.
